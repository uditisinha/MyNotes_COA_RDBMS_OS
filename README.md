# Notes_COA_RDBMS_OS

<h2>This repository contains hand-written notes that I made for RDBMS and OS.</h2>
<h3>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction (Module 1): This module covers database basics, comparing them to file systems, and discusses data independence, DBMS architecture, and the role of Database Administrators.</li><br>
  <li>Data Modeling (Module 2): This module covers data modeling, focusing on the Enhanced-Entity-Relationship (EER) and Relational Data Models. It includes the benefits, types, and phases of data modeling, ER and EER models, generalization, specialization, aggregation, and mapping EER to the relational model.</li><br>
  <li>Relational Algebra and Structure Query Language (Module 3): This module covers relational algebra and SQL, focusing on queries, data definition and manipulation, constraints, set operations, views, nested queries, triggers, and security and authorization.</li><br>
  <li>Query Processing and optimization (Module 4): This module covers query processing and optimization, including indexing concepts, hashing methods, query processing steps and costs, algorithms for SELECT and PROJECT operations, and optimization techniques.</li><br>
  <li>Transaction Management, Concurrency control and Recovery protocols (Module 6): This module covers transaction management, concurrency control, and recovery protocols, including transaction concepts and states, ACID properties, concurrency control methods, deadlock handling, and recovery systems like log-based recovery and shadow paging.</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>Operating System (OS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to System software(Module 1): This module introduces system software, covering various system programs like assemblers, loaders, linkers, macro processors, compilers, interpreters, operating systems, and device drivers. It includes OS objectives and functions, evolution, design for multiprocessor and multicore architectures, OS structures, system calls, Linux kernel and shell, and system boot.</li><br>
  <li>Process Concept and scheduling (Module 2): This module covers process concepts and scheduling, including process states, descriptions, control blocks, and operations. It discusses threads, multithreading, multicore processors, and thread types. It also covers uniprocessor scheduling, preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTN, Priority, Round Robin, Multilevel Queue), thread scheduling, and Linux scheduling.</li><br>
  <li>Input output and file management (Module 4): This module covers file management and I/O management. It includes file organization, access, directories, sharing, secondary storage management, Linux Virtual File System, I/O devices, OS design issues, I/O buffering, disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, CLOOK), disk management, and Linux I/O.</li><br>
  <li>Storage management (Module 5): This module covers storage management, focusing on main memory concepts (swapping, contiguous allocation, paging, segmentation, and 32/64-bit architectures) and virtual memory (demand paging, page replacement, allocation, thrashing, and kernel memory management).</li><br>
